            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name Juan an emerging photographer and software engineer based in Dallas, Texas. I began working
                with
                cameras and
                career.
                Once I mastered photography, I wanted to extend my knowledge in software engineering to develop a
                new
                skillset
                that will enhance my abilities overall. There are many great resources and software that are being
                developed
                each
                day, especially in photography. I believe once I pracatice my new skillset enough, I will be able to
                further
                make an impact in both the photography and engineering aspects.</p>
